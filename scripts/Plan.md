initial run: populate the yaml file itself        done, automatically

add infra: checking that all entries in that file are valid (copy-cat!)     done!

add a script to re-build the yaml file, assuming the repo data exists locally: done

download the data and automate everything: not yet :-)

create a new webpage on the community thing ---> adapt `make_site.py` accordingly

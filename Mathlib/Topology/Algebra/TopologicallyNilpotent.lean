/-! # Topologically nilpotent elements

Let `M` be a monoid with zero `M`, endowed with a topology.

* `IsTopologicallyNilpotent a` says that `a : M` is *topologically nilpotent*,
ie, its powers converge to zero.

* `IsTopologicallyNilpotent.map`:
The image of a topologically nilpotent element under a continuous morphism of
monoids with zero endowed with a topology is topologically nilpotent.

* `IsTopologicallyNilpotent.zero`: `0` is topologically nilpotent.

Let `R` be a commutative ring with a linear topology.

* `IsTopologicallyNilpotent.mul_left`: if `a : R` is topologically nilpotent,
then `a*b` is topologically nilpotent.

* `IsTopologicallyNilpotent.mul_right`: if `a : R` is topologically nilpotent,
then `a * b` is topologically nilpotent.

* `IsTopologicallyNilpotent.add`: if `a b : R` are topologically nilpotent,
then `a + b` is topologically nilpotent.
